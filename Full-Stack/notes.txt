Setting Up a Full Stack MERN Project!

1. Create new project folder
2. cd into the new project
3. If you want to create this full stack app in a git repository, do the following:
    git init                            //adds a .git hidden directory and initializes root folder as a local repo
    echo node_modules/ > .gitignore     //creates a .gitignore file in the app's root that will ignore all node_modules
4. Create your "server" folder
5. cd into the new server folder
6. Create a "server.js" file
7. Modularize the server project by creating the following folders:
    routes
    controllers
    config
    models
8. Create a new project within your server folder via "npm init -y"
9. Install your dependencies "npm install express mongoose"
10. Create your ".gitnore" file and add in "/node_modules"
11. In the config folder, create your "mongoose.config.js" file



11. In your server.js file, add the following code:
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 8000;
        
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port: ${port}`) );
12. Now time to create the React project. cd back into the root folder of the project.
13. When in the root folder, type "npx create-react-app client"
    Now you will be running two different servers: your front end React server with live reloading and your Express server.
