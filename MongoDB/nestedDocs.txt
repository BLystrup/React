Nested Documents
A nested document is a mongoose schema that contains a field with the value being a completely separate mongoose schema.

Simple Example using User Schema:
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
    fName: String;
    lName: String;
    friends: [UserSchema];
    }
)

Now the User Schema in a bank account application:
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        fName: String,
        lName: String,
        email: String,
        password: String,
        bankAccounts: [BankAccountSchema]
    }, {timestamps: true}
)

Since each bank account can have many transactions, we can nest a TransactionSchema into our BankAccountSchema:
const TransactionSchema: new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        amount: {type: Number, required: true},
        vender: {type: String, required: true}
    }, {timestamps: {createdAt: true} }
);

const BankAccountSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        accountType: {type: String, required: true},
        balance: {type: Number, default: 0},
        transactions: [TransactionSchema]
    }, {timestamps: true}
)
